## 0.2.1 - 2020-08-27

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where multiple copies of the same directory would show if the
  directory contained multiple files to be linked

## 0.2.0 - 2020-08-26

### Changed

- Manifests are now written with the [Config
  API](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.10.4/Config.html#content)
    - therefore the manifest version has increased to v2.0.0
- As a result of the above, harness now requires at least Elixir 1.9 for

### Fixed

- The harness project is reloaded after `mix harness.compile` when running `mix
  harness`
    - this fixes an issue where otp app atoms could not be determined on clean
      harness runs, as in CI

### Removed

- The `Harness.Cache` module has been removed
    - now harness caches packages by downloading them to the `deps/` directory
