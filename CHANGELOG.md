## 0.3.0 - 2021-02-17

### Added

- Added a `:skip_files` key to the configuration of a manifest, allowing one
  to provide a list of regex which will be checked against while sourcing files.
  Any files found to match any of the regex will be excluded from generation.
    - this allows a service author to 'take the reins' for that file

## 0.2.9 - 2020-11-02

### Fixed

- Fixed a broken link to the Getting Started guide from the About guide

## 0.2.8 - 2020-10-15

### Added

- Added a `mix harness.update` task that mimics `mix deps.update`

## 0.2.7 - 2020-10-15

### Fixed

- Misc. documentation fixes including:
    - a broken link to the Getting Started guide
    - addition of GitHub and Changelog links to hex page
    - default documentation page is set to the README

## 0.2.6 - 2020-10-12

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug present when running `mix harness.compile` in Elixir 1.11+

## 0.2.5 - 2020-10-06

### Changed

- Harness now explicitly depends on `:eex` as an extra_application
    - this resolves compilation warnings on elixir 1.11+

## 0.2.4 - 2020-10-05

### Changed

- Generated files are now formatted to a column width of 80

## 0.2.3 - 2020-09-22

### Changed

- Harness is now published to public hex

## 0.2.2 - 2020-08-30

### Added

- `Kernel` functions are now imported for templates by default.
    - e.g. `==/2` or `inspect/2`

## 0.2.1 - 2020-08-27

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where multiple copies of the same directory would show if the
  directory contained multiple files to be linked

## 0.2.0 - 2020-08-26

### Changed

- Manifests are now written with the [Config
  API](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.10.4/Config.html#content)
    - therefore the manifest version has increased to v2.0.0
- As a result of the above, harness now requires at least Elixir 1.9 for
  compatibility

## 0.1.2 - 2020-08-25

### Added

- A function to interpolate or inspect items into a template

## 0.1.1 - 2020-08-25

## 0.0.1 - 2020-08-24

### Added

- Vim swap files are now ignored from template directories

### Fixed

- The harness project is reloaded after `mix harness.compile` when running `mix
  harness`
    - this fixes an issue where otp app atoms could not be determined on clean
      harness runs, as in CI

### Removed

- The `Harness.Cache` module has been removed
    - now harness caches packages by downloading them to the `deps/` directory
    - this behaviour mimics `mix`
